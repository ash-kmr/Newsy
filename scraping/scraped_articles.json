(Express file photo by Dilip Kagda) RJD leader Lalu Prasad. (Express file photo by Dilip Kagda)\n\nLAST YEAR, the CBI\u2019s Economic Offences Division overruled objections from its legal wing, the Directorate of Prosecution, to press for an FIR against RJD leader Lalu Prasad, claiming that as Railway Minister in 2006, he facilitated the transfer of two railway hotels to a private firm in exchange for prime land in Patna.\n\nBut the Directorate of Prosecution, while drawing up a list of the alleged conspirators to be booked for the irregular transfer of the hotels, dropped the name of one of the two IRCTC officials named by the Economic Offences Division in its preliminary enquiry. The officer not included in the list was the then IRCTC Director (Tourism), Rakesh Saksena. It gave no reason for leaving out Saksena.\n\nAlthough several CBI officers pointed out the omission, the FIR \u2014 without Saksena\u2019s name \u2014 was registered on July 7, 2017 and was followed by searches at the offices and homes of the accused.\n\nThe CBI booked the following for criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal misconduct: Lalu Prasad, his wife Rabri Devi, their son Tejashwi Yadav, Delight Marketing Company Pvt Ltd\u2019s Sarla Gupta (wife of Prem Chand Gupta), Vijay Kochhar and Vinay Kochhar (directors of Sujata Hotels Pvt Ltd), M/s Lara Projects LLP and P K Goel, the then Managing Director of IRCTC.\n\nRead | Railway hotels: FIR filed after CBI legal wing said there\u2019s no evidence against Lalu Prasad\n\nIncidentally, Saksena was the official who initiated the proposal that the development, maintenance and operation of two railway hotels \u2014 one each in Ranchi and Puri, which were later awarded to Sujata Hotels Pvt Ltd of the Kochhars \u2014 be done through a public private partnership.\n\nIn July 2006, Saksena recommended that the hotels be handed over to private firms which had a minimum annual turnover of Rs 5 crore from such operations in the last three years, net worth of Rs 2 crore, a positive net profit in two out of the last three fiscals and experience of operating and maintaining at least a two-star hotel in the last five financial years.\n\nAlso read | A look at cases lodged against Lalu Prasad Yadav, his family\n\nThese qualification norms were promptly approved by Goel, the then IRCTC Managing Director.\n\nBut before a tender notice could be issued for these hotels, Saksena\u2019s Tourism wing proposed in October 2006 that the minimum turnover criteria be lowered from Rs 5 crore to Rs 3 crore and the net worth from Rs 2 crore to Rs 1 crore. This too was immediately approved by Goel.\n\nNo advertisement was issued to invite private sector response for these hotels but the sale of their tender documents was started through a passing reference in a tender notice on October 24, 2006 for a separate set of Rail Ratna Budget Hotels.\n\nThe eligibility conditions for these hotels came nine days later, through an advertisement which fixed November 30 as the last date for purchase of tender documents. But before the deadline got over, Saksena initiated a note for amendment of the eligibility conditions.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, he proposed reducing the two-star category status to two years from the earlier five years and proposed that it was not necessary that this certification be only from a \u201ccompetent authority\u201d. The accreditation could come from the bidder as well \u201cif official certification classification had not been taken or applied for\u201d.\n\nThese changes, done in the name of ensuring largescale participation by the hospitality industry, were approved by Goel and announced two days later.\n\nA CBI analysis of bid documents submitted by Sujata Hotels Pvt Ltd showed that it was not eligible for the contract as per the pre-conditions announced on November 3 since \u201cit did not have the two-star status during the preceding four years\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was only after eligibility conditions were changed that Sujata Hotels submitted their bids with self-certification that it had two-star category status in the preceding two years. Enquiries from Ministry of Tourism reveal that no such certificate was issued to Sujata Hotels for 2002-06,\u201d a CBI report said.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that there is no reasoning or logic for change of the criteria in respect of \u2018Star Category\u2019 during the course of the tender process stated in the files,\u201d it said.\n\nMoreover, it found that the entire process of award of tender \u201cappears to have been rigged and mangled by the officers of IRCTC in favour of Sujata Hotels\u201d as bid document of a competitor was found missing as well as the list of 15 firms that bought the tender documents for the hotel in Ranchi and 16 firms for the one in Puri.\n\nThough the CBI found that \u201cnothing has come on record to show that the company which benefited on account of the change in eligibility criteria extended any favours to the public servants of IRCTC\u201d, it included Goel and Saksena as co-conspirators.\n\nOn July 5, 2017, the legal wing retained Goel\u2019s name in the list of accused but dropped Saksena. It gave no reason. Two days later, the CBI registered a corruption case and conducted searches. Eight months later, the CBI is yet to file a chargesheet in the case.\n\nSaksena went on to become Divisional Railway Manager in Delhi where he remained until 2009. In 2013, he became Managing Director of Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation from where he retired in 2015.\n\nReached for comment Friday, Saksena, who now lives in Bhopal, said he did not know anything about the CBI case. \u201cI have no knowledge about this. Besides, I am currently in Bombay, I cannot speak to you,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "link": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cbi-booked-lalu-prasad-despite-objection-but-let-railway-official-get-away-5102709/", "published": "2018-03-19T05:01:00"}, {"title": "Rahul Gandhi\u2019s 2019 battle cry: Like Kauravas vs Pandavas, fight between truth and lies", "text": "Congress president Rahul Gandhi addresses the 84th Congress plenary session on Sunday.

Saying that Modi shares his name with \u201cthe one who carried out the biggest theft\u201d (Nirav Modi) and \u201cthe most corrupt man in cricket\u201d (Lalit Modi), Rahul said: \u201cThe name Modi symbolises the collusion between India\u2019s biggest crony capitalists and the Prime Minister of India.\u201d\n\nHe accused Modi of diverting attention from real problems like farm distress and unemployment with \u201cfancy events\u201d like \u201csurgical strike, demonetisation, Gabbar Singh Tax (GST) and Yoga Day\u201d. \u201cIf you are poor, your only choice is to become a farmer, labourer etc. You are destined to live in Modi\u2019s maya \u2014 of an imaginary world of acche din, Swachh Bharat, or Rs 15 lakh in your bank account. They will look straight into your eyes and say the hunger pain in your stomach is your imagination\u2026 There are no jobs, the farmers are dying\u2026 The Prime Minister says, \u2018let\u2019s go do yoga\u2019,\u201d said Rahul.\n\nBeginning his 50-minute-long speech with a reference to the Mahabharat, Rahul said: \u201cThousands of years ago, there was a huge battle on the fields of Kurukshetra. The Kauravas were powerful and arrogant. They had money and muscle power. The Pandavas, who had lost everything, fought for the truth. Like the Kauravas, BJP and RSS are designed to fight for power; like the Pandavas, Congress is designed to fight for truth.\u201d\n\nRahul said while people would accept a BJP \u2018drunk with power\u2019, they expected more from the Congress.

But they will never accept the same for the Congress\u2026 India expects much more from the Congress. India will not let us behave like the BJP. They will never let us lie. BJP is the voice of an organisation. But the Congress is the voice of the nation,\u201d said Rahul.\n\nRahul admitted that his party had let down the people in the last few years, when the UPA was in power.

India must never forget that when our leaders were in jail, their leader, Savarkar, was writing a letter begging for mercy from the British,\u201d he said.\n\nAsserting that the Congress would take the country forward, he said: \u201cBut we are humans, we make mistakes. Modiji thinks he is not human but an incarnation of God\u2026 We did not stand up to the expectations of the people. The people were let down by us\u2026 Will India live a lie or does it have the courage to face the truth? India will punish us if we do nothing but make a grab for power.\u201d\n\nCalling for changes within the Congress, Rahul said: \u201cThose who are seated in those back rows (pointing to the gallery) have the energy to change the world. But there is a wall between our leaders and them. My first job is to break down that wall. We will break it, not in rage but in love and respect for the seniors,\u201d he said.\n\nTargeting the RSS, Rahul raised the issues of Dalits being targeted in Una, and the killings of Targeting the RSS, Rahul raised the issues of Dalits being targeted in Una, and the killings of Gauri Lankesh and M M Kalburgi. (Express photo by Praveen Jain)\n\nMaintaining that there were many manifestations of that wall, he made a reference to distribution of tickets to outsiders and parachuting them to a constituency, while denying tickets to a committed worker. \u201cYou are the worker, you have Congress in you, you will get the ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave tickets to Congress workers in Gujarat, and Modiji was seen flying in seaplane. When we truly empower Congress workers, Prime Minister Modi will be seen in a submarine.\u201d\n\nAlleging that the corrupt and powerful control the conversation in the country, Rahul said while the BJP and its government talk about India emerging as the fastest growing economy, the youth don\u2019t have jobs and the market is filled with products from China. \u201cChina is everywhere \u2014 in all our shops, in Doklam, Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan and Bhutan. You can steal Rs 33,000 crore from the banks, the government will protect you.

They tell Tamils, change your beautiful language. They tell people of North-East, we don\u2019t like what you eat. They tell women to dress properly,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to the recent controversy involving the judiciary, Rahul said: \u201cBJP has spread fear. People from the press are scared. People go to court to solve their disputes. For the first time, we saw four Supreme Court judges running to the public for justice\u2026 There is a difference between the RSS and Congress: we respect the country\u2019s institutions, whereas they want to finish them. They want only one institution \u2014 the RSS,\u201d he said.\n\nRahul Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh at the Congress plenary session on Sunday.

Education and agriculture sectors would be the other priorities, he said.\n\n\u201cEducation is not just for the elite. The right to education belongs to every youngster, every religion, every class. There are not enough IIMs and IITs. We will spread higher education to every corner of India,\u201d he said. For the agriculture sector, he said farmers would be able to sell their produce to a network of food parks across the country.\n\nChidambaram and Rahul Gandhi at the Congress plenary session on Sunday.

Saying that people placed their trust in Modi four years ago, he said: \u201cBut that trust is now broken\u2026 the youth of the country are now asking questions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the AICC session authorised Rahul to elect the members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the decision-making body of the party.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n\u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd", "link": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rahul-gandhis-2019-battle-cry-like-kauravas-vs-pandavas-fight-between-truth-and-lies-congress-plenary-session-5102443/", "published": "2018-03-19T03:25:00"}, {"title": "J&K: 3 minor boys among five of family killed in Pakistan shelling", "text": "A girl from Poonch, injured in shelling by Pakistan, arrives for treatment in Jammu.

The clashes occurred in Medini Chowk under Nathnagar police station, a Muslim-dominated area.\n\nAccording to sources, the motorcycle procession was passing through the area at around 3.45 pm, when there was stone pelting.
